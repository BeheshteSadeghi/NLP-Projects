Artificial intelligence for automatic classification of needle EMG signals:A scoping review
This scoping review provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine and
deep learning techniques, in the interpretation of clinical needle electromyography (nEMG) signals.
Methods: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase and Web of Science was conducted to find peerreviewed journal articles. All papers published after 2010 were included. The methodological quality of
the included studies was assessed with CLAIM (checklist for artificial intelligence in medical imaging).
Results: 51 studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 61% used open-source EMGlab data
set to develop models to classify nEMG signal in healthy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and myopathy (25 subjects). Only two articles developed models to classify signals recorded at rest. Most articles
reported high performance accuracies, but many were subject to bias and overtraining.
Conclusions: Current AI-models of nEMG signals are not sufficient for clinical implementation.
Suggestions for future research include emphasizing the need for an optimal training and validation
approach using large datasets of clinical nEMG data from a diverse patient population.
Significance: The outcomes of this study and the suggestions made aim to contribute to developing AImodels that can effectively handle signal quality variability and are suitable for daily clinical practice
in interpreting nEMG signals.
